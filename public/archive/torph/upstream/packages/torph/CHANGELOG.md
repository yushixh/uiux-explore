# torph

## 0.1.3

### Patch Changes

- 9acfa1f: Fixes text leaving a morph landing in the wrong place inside a rotated or scaled element.

  #### Fixed
  - Departing characters were misplaced, and digits escaped the band they slide behind, when the morph sat inside a rotated or scaled element.

## 0.1.2

### Patch Changes

- 743ca6b: Keep caret matching honest in a field that groups its digits.

  #### Fixed
  - Typing in a number field that inserts thousand separators no longer scrambles the digits — a comma appearing beside the caret used to make neighbouring digits morph into each other.

- 743ca6b: Keep the box with a value that changes faster than the morph settles.

  #### Fixed
  - Text updated rapidly no longer sits in a box sized to an earlier value until the updates slow down.
  - A prop passed as `undefined` now falls back to its default instead of throwing.

- 743ca6b: Correct sizing for a value inside a rotated or scaled element.

  #### Fixed
  - A value inside a rotated or scaled element no longer grows with every morph.

## 0.1.1

### Patch Changes

- cde5096: Numbers morph by place value, and a morph is readable to screen readers.

  #### New
  - Number morphing, matched digit by digit. On by default — `numbers={false}` to opt out.
  - `update()` and the components accept a `number`, with `locale` and `decimals` options.
  - `cursorIndex`, for editable fields.
  - `segmentNumber`, `isNumericWord` and `decimalSeparator` exports.

  #### Improved
  - Digits keep their column, so `99 → 199` grows a digit on the left.
  - Currency symbols, percent signs and units stay put.
  - `COVID-19` and dates still morph as text.

  #### Fixed
  - Screen readers read the value, not its mid-morph fragments. Add `aria-live` to announce changes.
  - React's `onAnimationStart` and `onAnimationComplete` no longer go stale.

- 7b4e5e0: A word no longer character-morphs across a word that is staying put.

  #### Fixed
  - `Copy Address` → `Address Copied` no longer drags `Cop` past the `Address` between them.

## 0.1.0

### Minor Changes

- c86b1e0: Word- and character-level diffing, multi-line text, and a rewritten container animation

  #### New
  - Multi-line text.
  - Words that survive a change travel to their new position instead of crossfading.
  - `onAnimationCancel`, so a superseded morph can still be awaited.
  - `segmentText` and `diffSegments` exports.

  #### Fixed
  - Markup in a value could execute scripts in React.
  - The container no longer gets stuck at the wrong size.
