/* ══ Carousel ═════════════════════════════════════════════
   Cards on a turntable that drift at rest, give under the
   pointer, and can be swiped round.

   NOTHING EVER LEAVES THE FRAME, and that is the whole
   arrangement. This was a row twice — cards in a line, with
   the ones at the ends either dissolving into a mask or being
   cut by the edge of a box — and both are answers to the same
   question: what happens to a card when it runs out of block?
   A ring does not ask it. The cards go ROUND: out to one
   side, back and small, round to the other side, forward
   again. The furthest a card ever gets is the radius, which
   is a number this component chose, so there is no edge to
   treat and no box to put it in.

   IT IS THEREFORE ENDLESS. A row has a first card and a last
   one and has to decide what to do at each; a ring has
   neither, so the swipe never runs out and never rubber-bands.
   Swipe once and the front card shrinks and goes to the back
   while the next one comes forward — which is the motion he
   described, and it falls out of the geometry rather than
   being animated on top of it.

   THE ANGLE IS NOT TAKEN MODULO ANYTHING. `turn` counts up
   and down without limit and the angle is `(i - turn) * step`.
   Wrapping it to 0..360 would send a card the long way round
   the moment it crossed the seam, which is the one visible bug
   this arrangement can have — the same note the Pro sheet's
   reel carries, for the same reason.

   THREE MOTIONS, THREE ELEMENTS, ONE TRANSFORM EACH. The slot
   carries where the card is on the ring, the floater carries
   the drift, the card carries the tilt. They are nested rather
   than composed into one string because they are owned by
   three different things — the drag, a CSS animation and a
   pair of springs — and a single element cannot be written by
   three authors without one of them losing. */

/* ── the frame, and it is only a frame ─────────────────────
   No box, no clip, no mask. Nothing here hides its overflow,
   which is what makes the next decision affordable.

   ── SIZED FOR THE DEFAULT, NOT FOR THE EXTREMES ───────────
   This is the decision that matters on the wall. Sized to
   hold Spread 150 with Depth 0 and Float 100 — the widest the
   knobs can make the ring — the frame came to 520x404, and at
   the arrangement it actually SHIPS at that left 40px of air
   either side and 50 top and bottom. Measured. That is dead
   space the wall pays for on every card: a block is fitted to
   its column by its bounding BOX, so air inside the box is
   the block being drawn smaller.

   476x340 is the shipping ring plus about eighteen pixels of
   margin. The card is 37% of the frame where it was 28.6%,
   and the overlay draws it 9% bigger as well, because the fit
   there is LOCK over the larger side.

   What it costs: at the far corners of the knobs the ring
   paints a little outside the frame. Nothing clips, so it
   simply overlaps the padding the wall card keeps around a
   block, and only when Spread, Depth and Float are all at
   once at settings nobody ships. The same trade the Balance
   card makes when it stretches past its own measured box.

   The cards also keep growing faster than the frame, for the
   same reason: 160x226 in 440x340 was 24% of the frame in
   card, 188x266 in 474x384 was 27%, 206x292 in 476x340 is
   37%.

   Fixed at these two numbers, because a frame that grew with
   a knob would rescale the whole block every time one moved —
   which is the thing the ResizeObserver on the wall and the
   overlay would both do. */

   own value and that is a knob with nothing above it, so

   rides UP as it recedes is unmistakably going back, because
   that is what a ring seen from slightly above does. It costs
   one term and it is most of what makes the depth read.

   38 rather than 22 for a second reason: at 22 the card at
   the very back was invisible — 226 tall drawn at 0.75 and
   lifted 22 puts its top edge 6px BELOW the front card's, so

   It was a 3..6 knob while the cards were coloured faces,

   to be one of them a second time, and the same picture twice
   on one ring reads as a bug rather than as a setting. So the
   number of cards is `SHOTS.length` and nothing else —
   add a file, run the script, and the ring has another
   position. Five today.

   Five is also the better ring. With four, one card sits at
   180 degrees, which is directly behind the front one and out
   of sight; at 72-degree steps nothing is ever exactly
   behind anything, so every card is at least partly visible
   at rest and the ring reads as a ring rather than as three

   would wrap a fifth card onto the first card's angle, and
   two of five sharing an angle is the pattern this list

/* ── one spring, for everything that settles ───────────────
   The maths was already on this bench twice, copied by hand:
   Humidity's wheel and Brightness's column both accumulate
   velocity toward a target, damp it, and snap when both the
   delta and the velocity fall under 0.02. Two copies is a
   coincidence; five would be a policy, so it comes out here
   before the elastic blocks are written against it.

   The two shipped copies are deliberately NOT refactored onto
   this. They work, they are tuned, and rewriting the innards
   of two live components to prove a point about duplication
   is how a good afternoon becomes a bad one. This is the one
   new code uses.

   Frames, not milliseconds. `dt` is expressed in sixtieths of
   a second and the damping is RAISED to it rather than
   multiplied by it, so a dropped frame decays the same amount
   of energy as the two frames it replaced. Multiplying is the
   version that makes a spring behave differently on a busy
   page, which is the hardest kind of bug to see.

   The loop parks itself the moment the value has settled.
   CLAUDE.md is not complimentary about the one permanent
   requestAnimationFrame already on this bench and there is no
   case for five more. */

   50 is what Humidity and Brightness were tuned at, which is
   the rule every elastic knob on this bench follows — see
   lab/motion. Turn the panel to the middle and nothing has
   changed.

   Both ends have to be usable, which is what fixes the range:
   at 0 it is slow and heavy and still arrives, at 100 it is
   quick with a visible overshoot, and nowhere in between does
   it ring for longer than it takes to read. */

   as stiffness and decay, because the ratio is the thing a
   person is actually setting and the two numbers on their own

   The first version of this ran 0.06..0.26 stiffness against
   0.93..0.74 decay, which reads as a sensible spread and is
   not one: it puts zeta between 0.15 and 0.16 across the
   WHOLE range, so every setting overshot by about sixty per
   cent and the knob only changed how fast it did it. Pull's
   return went 130px past its own resting position and lifted
   the content off the top of the card.

     0   → zeta ~0.85, heavy, arrives without a ring
     50  → zeta ~0.41, near where Humidity and Brightness sit

   safe to expose: the default is not a number somebody has to
   remember, it is the middle of the slider.
