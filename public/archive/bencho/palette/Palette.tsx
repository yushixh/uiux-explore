/* ══ Palette ══════════════════════════════════════════════
   Three to five colours that go together, and a button that
   finds you another set.

   ── THE COLOURS ARE PICKED IN OKLCH ───────────────────────
   Which is the entire difference between this and the random
   hex generator everybody writes first. In HSL, `lightness`
   is a lie: hsl(60 90% 50%) is a bright yellow and
   hsl(240 90% 50%) is a near-black blue, at the same number.
   So a palette built by holding L and stepping the hue comes
   out with one swatch that glows and one you can barely see.

   OKLCH is perceptually uniform — equal steps in L look like
   equal steps — so a ramp written in it is a ramp you can
   actually see. The palette is generated there and converted
   to hex on the way out, because hex is what somebody wants
   to paste into their own file.

   ── AND THEY ARE A RAMP, NOT A SPIN ───────────────────────
   Four random hues do not make a palette however even their
   lightness is. What makes a set look chosen is that it
   agrees about one thing and varies another: these hold a
   hue family and ramp the LIGHTNESS across it, which is what
   a designer does by hand.

   Chroma peaks in the middle rather than being held flat, for
   the same reason a very light and a very dark colour cannot
   be vivid — there is no room left in the gamut, and asking
   for it is what makes generated palettes go chalky at one
   end and muddy at the other. */

/* ── oklch → hex ───────────────────────────────────────────
   Björn Ottosson's matrices, unchanged. The path is
   oklch → oklab → LMS → linear sRGB → sRGB, and the only
   liberty taken is the clamp at the end: a colour outside the
   gamut is clipped per channel rather than gamut-mapped,
   which is the wrong answer in general and a fine one here
   because the chroma below never asks for one. */

/* ── one palette ───────────────────────────────────────────
   A base hue, a step between neighbours, and a ramp down the
   lightness. Everything else falls out of those three.

   The step is small and can go either way — 16 to 34 degrees
   — which keeps the family analogous rather than scattered. A
   wider spread is not a bolder palette, it is a list of
   colours.

   One set in three gets an ACCENT: the last swatch jumps most
   of the way round the wheel. A ramp on its own is tasteful
   and slightly dull, and the odd jump is what stops a run of
   generated sets feeling like one set regenerated.

   150 to 175 degrees rather than a flat 180. A true
   complement is the harshest pair on the wheel — it was
   putting a forest green on the end of a set of pinks, which
   is a colour theory exercise rather than a palette. Backing
   off a few degrees is the split-complement every painter
   uses instead, and it keeps the accent surprising without
   making it an argument.

   And it continues in the ramp's own direction rather than
   picking a side: an accent that jumped backwards past the

/* ── the layout ────────────────────────────────────────────
   TWO PILLS SIDE BY SIDE: the colours in one, the refresh in
   its own. It was a single slab with the button tucked in at
   the right, which made the button part of the palette — and
   it is not, it is the thing that replaces the palette. A
   control that acts on an object should not be sitting inside
   it.

   Split, the two read as what they are: a display and a
   button. They share a height, a padding and a corner, so
   nothing about them says they are unrelated — only that they
   are two things.

   The swatches inside the first pill are still SEGMENTS of one
   bar rather than four cards in a row: a palette is one thing
   made of parts, and four separate tiles read as four separate
   decisions.

   The button pill's inside is one swatch square, and its
   button takes the swatch's corner — so the tool pill holds a
   swatch-shaped thing and the corner knob moves both. */

/* ── how wide the refresh is ───────────────────────────────
   The button is as TALL as a swatch and much narrower than
   one. It was a square, which made the tool pill the same
   shape as the thing it acts on and gave an 18px glyph a 58px
   box to sit in — a lot of empty pill for one icon.

   30 against a 58 height is nearly two to one, which is what
   makes it read as a KEY: an upright slot you press, rather
   than a tile that happens to have a glyph on it. There is no
   hover fill for it to need room for any more — the glyph
   just lightens — so the six pixels either side of the icon
   are the whole of what the button has to hold.

   Every pixel it gives up goes to the colours: the swatches
   are 53 wide now, against 45 when this was a square. */
const TOOL = 30;
/* ── the air between the two pills ─────────────────────────
   6, and it is no longer PAD. Those two were deliberately the
   same number once, back when the button sat INSIDE the slab:
   the gap beside the bar and the gap above it were the same
   kind of space, and two numbers there would have been a
   decision nobody made.

   They are two objects now, and the space BETWEEN two objects
   is not the space inside one. At 10 the pills read as two
   things that happen to be near each other; at 6 they read as
   a pair — near enough to belong together, far enough apart
   to be separate, which is exactly what they are. */

   Small on purpose. The bar was one flush strip and the
   colours were segments of it, which meant the rounded ends
   had to come from the container clipping them — and a swatch
   that cannot leave its slot cannot overshoot, so the elastic
   on the way back was being cut off at the edges.

   Four is enough to read as four objects and not enough to
   stop reading as one bar. It is also what lets the goo do
   something at rest-adjacent moments: a blur of five bridges
   four pixels, so the swatches neck toward each other as they
   move and part again cleanly. */

/* ── the one way a colour becomes another one ──────────────
   ORB: the swatch draws into a circle, changes colour there,
   and spreads back out into its slot.

   There were five, then three, and now one. The other four
   were not broken — `pinch` necked into a droplet, `flip`
   turned edge-on, `split` parted in two, `bounce` squashed
   flat — but a block that ships four ways to do one thing is
   asking whoever opens it to rule out three by hand, and none
   of them said anything this does not.

   What every survivor had in common, and every discarded one
   lacked, is worth keeping written down: the swatch DEFORMS
   and swaps its colour at the frame there is least of it to
   look at. Nothing here fades one colour into another. An
   alpha-contrast filter blurs SourceGraphic, so anything
   painting a new colour over an old one inside the same
   swatch shows you the two smeared together — every muddy
   value in between, and none of them in either palette. Each
   swatch is one solid colour at every frame, and the blur only
   ever bridges the gap BETWEEN swatches. That is liquid; the
   other thing is smear. */

/* ── they all go at once ───────────────────────────────────
   Every swatch runs the same clock. They used to be staggered,
   each on its own window of the run, so the change travelled
   along the bar — which is a nice effect and the wrong one
   here. A wave says the swatches are a sequence and that one
   caused the next; they are not, they are a set, and pressing
   refresh replaces all of them in the same instant. Together
   is what that press actually did.

   It also makes the goo mean more rather than less: four
   swatches contracting on the same frame leave four gaps
   opening at the same rate, and the bridge between them is one
   piece of motion instead of a blur chasing a wavefront. */

/* ── out fast, back PAST the mark ──────────────────────────
   The deformation is not a sine. A sine is symmetric and
   lands exactly on rest, which is a shape being resized; what
   makes these read as elastic is that the return overshoots —
   the swatch comes back a few per cent bigger than it needs to
   be and settles. That is the whole difference between
   `animated` and `springy`, and it costs one back-out curve.

   ── why the filter is a hook ────────────────────────────
   The filter is embedded in each component's own return, but
   its id CANNOT be a literal. Every block here renders twice
   at once — once in the wall card, once in the detail overlay
   — and duplicate SVG ids do not scope, they collide: the
   second instance silently steals the first one's filter.
   useId() gives each mount its own name.

   ── what the goo can and cannot do ──────────────────────
   This is feGaussianBlur + feColorMatrix, not a shader. The
   matrix multiplies alpha by `cut` and subtracts half of it,
   so alpha below 0.5 lands on zero and everything above 0.536
   is fully opaque. That hard edge is what fuses nearby shapes
   into one blob — and it is also why this must never touch
   text: glyph antialiasing lives entirely below 0.5, so type
   under this filter loses its edges and then itself. */

   inside is real units, and **50 is always what the component

   The maths was already on this bench twice, copied by hand:
   Humidity's wheel and Brightness's column both accumulate
   velocity toward a target, damp it, and snap when both the
   delta and the velocity fall under 0.02. Two copies is a
   coincidence; five would be a policy, so it comes out here
   before the elastic blocks are written against it.

   The two shipped copies are deliberately NOT refactored onto
   this. They work, they are tuned, and rewriting the innards
   of two live components to prove a point about duplication
   is how a good afternoon becomes a bad one. This is the one
   new code uses.

   Frames, not milliseconds. `dt` is expressed in sixtieths of
   a second and the damping is RAISED to it rather than
   multiplied by it, so a dropped frame decays the same amount
   of energy as the two frames it replaced. Multiplying is the
   version that makes a spring behave differently on a busy
   page, which is the hardest kind of bug to see.

     flat rule leaves square swatches sitting in a rounded
     slab — two different decisions in one object, which is
     the thing this knob exists to keep in agreement.

  /* ── the beat ────────────────────────────────────────────
     The whole colour pill dips while the swatches are drawn
     in, and comes back a hair past its own size — the swatches
     contracting is a small motion happening inside a box that
     is not moving, and the box giving with them is what makes
     the press land on the palette rather than on four shapes
     in it.

     This is the one place here that uses a SCALE rather than
     writing width and height, which is normally how a corner
     radius gets dragged out of shape. At three and a half per
     cent it is under a pixel of radius, and more to the point
     nobody reads a pulse as a change of shape — they read it
     as a pulse. Writing the size instead would relayout the
     bar under the swatches every frame, which is the thing
     actually worth avoiding.

     Raw `swellOf`, not the clamped `d` the swatches use: the
     tail of that curve goes past rest, so the pill returns
     slightly over 1 and settles. That overshoot IS the beat —
     clamp it away and this is just a shrink. */
