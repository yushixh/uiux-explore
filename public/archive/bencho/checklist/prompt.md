Add the "Checklist" component from Bencho to my project.

It is MIT licensed — bencho.dev/licence. Please:

1. Create the component at a sensible path for this
   project, named Checklist, from the source below.
2. Install what it needs: npm i framer-motion
3. Add the CSS to the project's stylesheet.

4. THE PART THAT NEEDS YOUR JUDGEMENT. The CSS reads
   these custom properties and does not define them:

     --card
     --fill-on
     --fill-on-rgb
     --fill-slab
     --font-ui
     --ink
     --ink-rgb
     --pane-edge

   They are Bencho's design tokens. Map each one to
   whatever this project already uses for the same
   job — its own ink, ground, surface and UI font —
   rather than defining them as new globals. If the
   project has no equivalent, define it locally on
   the component's own root so nothing leaks out.
   Anything ending -rgb wants three bare numbers,
   because the CSS builds rgba() from it.

Keep the comments. They say why the numbers are what
they are, and they are most of what makes this worth
copying rather than rewriting.

/* ══ Checklist ════════════════════════════════════════════
   Three tasks, and the only thing this block does is cross
   one out.

   ONE SPRING PER ROW, AND EVERYTHING IS READ OFF IT. The box
   filling, the tick drawing, the rule crossing the words and
   the words giving up their ink are four readings of a single
   number, not four things animated toward the same moment.
   With four transitions there are four chances for one to
   arrive early and break the illusion that this is one event;
   with one number there are none — the same rule the player
   follows, and the reason nothing in this component's
   stylesheet carries a transition of its own.

   WHERE THE OVERSHOOT IS ALLOWED, AND WHERE IT IS NOT. A
   spring goes past its target and comes back, which is what
   makes a check feel like a press rather than a state change
   — but only some of these can survive that. The fill takes
   the raw value, so the box swells past full and settles. The
   TICK and the RULE take it clamped: a tick that overshoots
   draws itself past its own end and pulls back, which is a
   glitch rather than a bounce, and a rule that overshoots
   runs off the end of the word it is crossing out.

   One spring, two readings of it, and the difference is one
   `clamp`. */

const clamp = (v: number, lo: number, hi: number) => Math.min(hi, Math.max(lo, v));
const mix = (a: number, b: number, t: number) => a + (b - a) * t;

const W = 300;
/* the inset, and it is the SAME on all four sides — which is
   not what `padding: 14px` gives you here. See the note where
   it is used. */

   row has left over after the box, twice — so 52 put 30px
   between them and read as a list of three separate things.
   40 leaves 18, which is a list. */
const ROW = 40;
/* 18, against 14px text. 22 was the first number and it had
   no reasoning behind it beyond looking balanced on its own —
   which is the trap with a control next to type: a checkbox is
   sized against the LINE it sits beside, and at 22 it was
   half again the cap height of the words it belonged to and
   read as the subject of the row rather than as its switch. */

   Both are read off the same spring, but the rule starts a
   tenth of the way in and finishes a little early — so the
   box answers first and the words are crossed out after,
   which is the order the two things actually happen in when a
   person ticks something off a list. Started together they
   read as one wipe across the whole row; started apart they
   read as cause and effect.

   It is a window on the same number rather than a second
   timer, so there is nothing to keep in step. */
const LAG = 0.12;
const RUN = 0.72;

/* ══ the finish ═══════════════════════════════════════════
   Tick the last open task and the list FALLS DOWN.

   What was here was a celebration: a box that bounced, three
   marks that redrew, the rows gathering in, a squish, and a
   four-point glint out of the middle of the card. All of it
   ran off one clock, which was the right way to build the
   wrong idea — five flourishes agreeing with each other is
   still five flourishes, and the glint in particular was a
   sparkle sitting on top of a list, which is what every
   "well done" animation on the internet already is.

   This is one idea instead. Finishing the list takes the
   floor out from under it: the three rows stop being held up,
   fall, and land in a heap on the bottom edge of the card.
   Nothing congratulates you. The list is simply over, and it
   behaves like something that is over.

   And the card is the size it always was. See the note on the
   collapse below: the distance comes out of the list closing
   up, not out of empty floor added under it. */

/* ── THE FALL IS A COLLAPSE, not a drop ───────────────────
   The card is exactly as tall as its three rows again, which
   is where it started and where it belongs — a checklist with
   a hundred pixels of empty floor under it is a checklist that
   looks unfinished. So there is nowhere to fall TO, and the
   distance has to come from somewhere else.

   It comes from the rows closing up. A row is 40px tall and
   the thing you can see in it — the box and the words — is
   barely twenty: the rest is the reason the whole row is a
   target rather than the checkbox alone. Standing in a list
   those gaps are what makes it a list. Lying in a heap they
   are nothing, and the slips settle against each other.

   So the heap is tighter than the list by twice that slack per
   row, and THAT is the fall. The bottom row barely moves, the
   top one travels the whole compaction, and each lands where
   the one below it stopped. */

/* ── what a row actually looks like ───────────────────────
   The taller of its checkbox and its line of type, and NOTHING
   added on top of that — both MEASURED, because the line box
   of 14px type is not 14px and a guess at it is a guess at how
   close two slips can lie. Derived from the Box knob, so the heap
   stays tight at every setting of it rather than at the
   default one.

   It carried four pixels of air at first, on the reasoning
   that a slip wants a margin. It does not: the slip is the
   card's own colour, so its edge is invisible and the margin
   is not protecting anything — the only thing that must not
   happen is a neighbour's slip covering this row's words, and
   the derived gap already guarantees with room to spare. What the
   four pixels DID do was eat the fall, because every pixel of
   slack a slip keeps is a pixel the heap cannot close up.
   Measured at the largest Box: 10px of collapse with the
   padding, 18 without it. */
const BODY = (side: number, line: number) => Math.max(side, line);

   proportion, because they are all under one gravity */
const DROP_MS = 0.46;
/* how far it comes back up off the floor, at most. A landing
   with no bounce at all reads as a card being placed — but a
   9px rebound on an 8px fall reads as a trampoline, so it is
   capped against the distance actually travelled. */

const HOLD = 3000;

/* ── the heap ──────────────────────────────────────────────
   Three slips landing on each other do not land square, and
   the tilt is what stops this reading as the list closing up.
   Small — three degrees is a shrug, not a mess — and different
   per row so the eye cannot find a pattern in it. */
/* ── THE TILT IS THE OVERHANG ──────────────────────────────
   It was a hand-written fan: five numbers, the same lean every
   time, whatever was written on the slips. Which is fine until
   you notice what it is pretending to be. A slip lying on
   another slip is held up by exactly as much of it as there is
   underneath; the rest hangs, and what hangs, tips.

   So the lean comes out of the WORDS now. Each row is measured
   — the box, the gap and the line of type, to the end of the
   text — and a slip that is longer than the one it lands on
   overhangs to the right by the difference and leans that way.
   A shorter one is fully carried and adds nothing of its own.

   It ACCUMULATES from the floor up, because a slip resting on
   a tilted slip starts tilted: the bottom one lies flat on the
   card, and every one above inherits the lean of what it is
   lying on plus whatever its own overhang adds. That is what
   makes a heap of long-then-short read differently from
   short-then-long, which is the whole point of measuring.

   The response SATURATES rather than being a rate. Straight
   degrees-per-pixel put the default list at 0.9 degrees, which
   is a heap you have to be told is leaning, and then needed a
   clamp anyway the moment somebody typed a long task. This
   curve is at two degrees for the sixteen pixels those three
   tasks differ by, four and a half by sixty, and never reaches
   six — which is the angle where a slip stops looking like it
   is resting on something and starts looking dropped. */

const REACH = 40;
const leanOf = (over: number) => MAX_LEAN * (1 - Math.exp(-over / REACH));
/* the sideways untidiness, which the words have no opinion
   about — this is the one thing left that is just chosen */
const DRIFT = [-5, 4, -2, 5, -3];

/* ── the daylight between two slips ───────────────────────
   Tilting a slip moves its ends: two of them leaning by
   different amounts converge on one side, and if they converge
   by more than the gap the upper one's edge covers the lower
   one's words. So the spacing is computed from the leans
   rather than picked — and since the leans now come from the
   text, per render.

   MEASURED WHERE THE INK IS, not across the row. This used to
   ask what the slips do at x = 272, which is the end of the
   ROW — and the row is invisible. A slip is the card's own
   colour; the only place it can hide anything is where there
   is something under it to hide, and the words stop at 131 to
   147px. Asking the question at the end of the row inflated
   the gap to 5.7px for a two degree lean when the real answer
   at the end of the WORDS is 0.4, and pushed every slip five
   pixels apart for a collision that could not happen.

   Rotation is about the row's middle, so a point at x is
   displaced by (x - middle) * sin. The worst case between two
   slips is at the far end of the longer one's ink. */

/* ── inlined from ./spring ──────────────────────── */
/* ── one spring, for everything that settles ───────────────
   The maths was already on this bench twice, copied by hand:
   Humidity's wheel and Brightness's column both accumulate
   velocity toward a target, damp it, and snap when both the
   delta and the velocity fall under 0.02. Two copies is a
   coincidence; five would be a policy, so it comes out here
   before the elastic blocks are written against it.

   The two shipped copies are deliberately NOT refactored onto
   this. They work, they are tuned, and rewriting the innards
   of two live components to prove a point about duplication
   is how a good afternoon becomes a bad one. This is the one
   new code uses.

   Frames, not milliseconds. `dt` is expressed in sixtieths of
   a second and the damping is RAISED to it rather than
   multiplied by it, so a dropped frame decays the same amount
   of energy as the two frames it replaced. Multiplying is the
   version that makes a spring behave differently on a busy
   page, which is the hardest kind of bug to see.

   The loop parks itself the moment the value has settled.
   CLAUDE.md is not complimentary about the one permanent
   requestAnimationFrame already on this bench and there is no
   case for five more. */

/* 0..100 into the two numbers a spring actually has.

   50 is what Humidity and Brightness were tuned at, which is
   the rule every elastic knob on this bench follows — see
   lab/motion. Turn the panel to the middle and nothing has
   changed.

   Both ends have to be usable, which is what fixes the range:
   at 0 it is slow and heavy and still arrives, at 100 it is
   quick with a visible overshoot, and nowhere in between does
   it ring for longer than it takes to read. */
/* The pair is chosen by DAMPING RATIO and then written back
   as stiffness and decay, because the ratio is the thing a
   person is actually setting and the two numbers on their own
   do not say what they add up to.

     zeta = -ln(d) / (2 * sqrt(k))

   The first version of this ran 0.06..0.26 stiffness against
   0.93..0.74 decay, which reads as a sensible spread and is
   not one: it puts zeta between 0.15 and 0.16 across the
   WHOLE range, so every setting overshot by about sixty per
   cent and the knob only changed how fast it did it. Pull's
   return went 130px past its own resting position and lifted
   the content off the top of the card.

     0   → zeta ~0.85, heavy, arrives without a ring
     50  → zeta ~0.41, near where Humidity and Brightness sit
     100 → zeta ~0.20, lively, two visible rebounds
