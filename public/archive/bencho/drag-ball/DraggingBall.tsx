/* ══ Dragging ball ════════════════════════════════════════
   One circle, and the only thing it does is follow your
   finger. What makes it worth a card is the TRAIL: the ball
   itself is pinned to the pointer with no lag at all, and a
   second body chases it a beat behind, so the goo between them
   stretches into a tail while you are moving and collapses
   back into a circle the moment you stop.

   Which is the same construction as the liquid toggle's
   straggler, with the drag standing in for the spring: there
   the thumb was thrown to a destination, here it is held.

   ── the rules this obeys ────────────────────────────────
   The bodies are in FLOW, both in one grid cell — an
   absolutely positioned child measures as a zero-radius box
   and the filter draws nothing. The group's fill is OPAQUE,
   because the contrast step erases anything under about 0.39
   alpha. And the layer takes the 1/k correction, because
   `move` measures screen pixels and every card here is drawn
   at a fraction of its size. */

const WELL = { w: 300, h: 200 };

/* ── how the grab reads ────────────────────────────────────
   A ball you can drag and a ball you have to GRAB are the
   same interaction with one thing added: the object has to
   answer the hand before it moves. Three beats, and none of
   them is the drag itself —

     hover   it swells a little, so you know it is live
     press   it PINCHES, narrower and taller, the way a soft
             thing does between two fingers
     let go  it rounds back out on a spring

   The pinch is the one doing the work, and it is a pinch
   rather than a uniform shrink on purpose. A circle that gets
   smaller reads as a button being pressed INTO a surface;
   this one is not on a surface, it is in your hand, and what
   a held ball does is narrow across the grip and bulge along
   it. Area is roughly kept — 0.16 out of the width against
   0.08 into the height — so it reads as squeezed rather than
   as resized.

   It goes on the span's transform, which the metaball filter
   honours: the library renders the child inside the filtered
   group rather than drawing a circle from its measurements,
   so the silhouette pinches with it. Verified by pushing a
   scaleX into the node and watching the painted body change
   shape.

   ALL THREE BEATS RIDE THE ONE KNOB, hover included. Grip is
   not "how hard the squeeze is", it is how much the ball
   answers a hand at all — so at 0 it does not swell either,
   and 0 is exactly the block this was before: a circle that
   follows your finger and does nothing else. A knob whose
   bottom end is the old component is the honest kind. */

/* ══ Gooey ════════════════════════════════════════════════
   What is left of the two library-surfaced components that
   used to live here: the measurement every liquid-gooey group
   on the bench needs. Liquid tabs and the Plus menu are gone;
   this is the part of them that turned out to be the reusable
   half, and Balance, the Selection list, the Humidity wheel
   and the Sleep dial all still call it.

   ── what the library actually does ──────────────────────
   The usual gooey effect runs blur + alpha-contrast over your
   real UI, which is why it is normally confined to decorative
   circles: text goes soft, images smear, and the contrast step
   eats shadows. liquid-gooey splits it in two. An SVG layer
   carries a silhouette of your elements and takes the whole
   filter; your actual DOM rides crisp on top of it, untouched.
   Same liquid, none of the tax — and it is the same discipline
   our own filter needs, since text under an alpha threshold
   loses its edges and then itself.

   ── the two patterns, which are not interchangeable ─────
   MORPH gives the library the position: pass x/y and it
   animates the element and the liquid together, so pieces that
   separate stay bridged until the goo can no longer hold them.
   The split IS the effect.

   MOVE gives the position to you: move the element however you
   like and the surface trails it as liquid rubber with a
   droplet tail. A filter has no memory of motion — a shape
   that crossed two pixels and one that crossed the whole track
   arrive identical — and this is the part that fixes that. */

/* ── the zoom correction, applied to someone else's SVG ──────
   liquid-gooey measures its items with getBoundingClientRect
   and draws them as SVG user units. Those are the same number
   only while no ancestor is scaled — and on this bench every
   component sits inside a scaled card, so the transform lands
   twice and the silhouette drifts from its element in
   proportion to both the scale and the distance from the
   origin. Measured: 0.1px at scale 1, 22px at 1.09, 124px at
   1.4.

   Everything the library computes is in screen px, so scaling
   its layer by 1/k converts the whole coordinate space back to
   layout px in one move, and the card's own transform then
   renders it correctly. Same k = rect.width / offsetWidth the
   rest of the bench uses.

   MOVE ONLY. Morph positions its items with a CSS transform on
   a real wrapper, in layout px, which scales correctly on its
   own — apply this there and you over-correct: the silhouette
   comes out 1/k the size of its button, so the blob is smaller
   than the element and every icon looks off-centre inside it.
   Measured on the plus menu: button 58px, blob 46px, and up to
   10px of offset. Without it, 58 and 58, dead on. */

           the --slab doctrine in CLAUDE.md and it is what makes
           the Fill control safe on a component with no ground
           of its own — the ink version was a near-black disc
           that vanished on a near-black card, which is the trap
           the liquid toggle fell into twice.

           It said `--board` for a long time, which was the same
           colour and so looked like the same decision. It was
           not: --board is the theme's raised grey and
           --fill-slab is THIS component's fill, and the day the
           dark fill moved off --board the ball stayed behind
           and disappeared into the card. Naming the token you

           happens to be right and one that stays right.

           No shadow. It carried one — on the group, so it
           followed the silhouette as it stretched — and the
           cost of taking it away is that a white ball on the
           card's own grey is about 1.06:1. The disc reads, but
           it reads as a shape rather than as an object lifted
