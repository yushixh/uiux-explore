/* ── FOUR BANDS, AND THE COLOUR LIVES IN CSS ───────────────
   It was three, and their hexes were written here: amber under
   25, blue over 80, a green between. Two things were wrong
   with that and one thing was missing.

   Wrong first: a hard hex cannot answer the theme. Every other
   signal colour on this bench is a token that swaps with the
   ramp, and these three stayed put — the green in particular
   was #16a34a, a text green, where the balance chart had
   already worked out that a THIN STROKE needs a brighter one
   to read as the same colour. These ticks are 2px.

   So this returns a NAME and the stylesheet holds the values,
   which is how the wheel gets both a light and a dark palette
   and how its green can be the chart's green without either
   file naming a number the other has to match.

   And the thing missing: red. "Critical" was amber, which is
   the colour of a warning rather than of a problem — there was
   nothing left to say when it got worse. So the bottom splits:
   under 12 is red and means it, 12 to 25 is the amber warning
   it always was.

   The labels stay even though nothing renders them. They are
   what the four numbers MEAN, and a band called "low" reads
   better at the call site than `v < 25`. */
function stateFor(v: number) {
  if (v < 12) return { label: "Critical", key: "crit" };
  if (v < 25) return { label: "Low", key: "low" };

/* ── inlined from ./Gooey ──────────────────────── */
/* ══ Gooey ════════════════════════════════════════════════
   What is left of the two library-surfaced components that
   used to live here: the measurement every liquid-gooey group
   on the bench needs. Liquid tabs and the Plus menu are gone;
   this is the part of them that turned out to be the reusable
   half, and Balance, the Selection list, the Humidity wheel
   and the Sleep dial all still call it.

   ── what the library actually does ──────────────────────
   The usual gooey effect runs blur + alpha-contrast over your
   real UI, which is why it is normally confined to decorative
   circles: text goes soft, images smear, and the contrast step
   eats shadows. liquid-gooey splits it in two. An SVG layer
   carries a silhouette of your elements and takes the whole
   filter; your actual DOM rides crisp on top of it, untouched.
   Same liquid, none of the tax — and it is the same discipline
   our own filter needs, since text under an alpha threshold
   loses its edges and then itself.

   ── the two patterns, which are not interchangeable ─────
   MORPH gives the library the position: pass x/y and it
   animates the element and the liquid together, so pieces that
   separate stay bridged until the goo can no longer hold them.
   The split IS the effect.

   MOVE gives the position to you: move the element however you
   like and the surface trails it as liquid rubber with a
   droplet tail. A filter has no memory of motion — a shape
   that crossed two pixels and one that crossed the whole track
   arrive identical — and this is the part that fixes that. */

/* ── the zoom correction, applied to someone else's SVG ──────
   liquid-gooey measures its items with getBoundingClientRect
   and draws them as SVG user units. Those are the same number
   only while no ancestor is scaled — and on this bench every
   component sits inside a scaled card, so the transform lands
   twice and the silhouette drifts from its element in
   proportion to both the scale and the distance from the
   origin. Measured: 0.1px at scale 1, 22px at 1.09, 124px at
   1.4.

   Everything the library computes is in screen px, so scaling
   its layer by 1/k converts the whole coordinate space back to
   layout px in one move, and the card's own transform then
   renders it correctly. Same k = rect.width / offsetWidth the
   rest of the bench uses.

   MOVE ONLY. Morph positions its items with a CSS transform on
   a real wrapper, in layout px, which scales correctly on its
   own — apply this there and you over-correct: the silhouette
   comes out 1/k the size of its button, so the blob is smaller
   than the element and every icon looks off-centre inside it.
   Measured on the plus menu: button 58px, blob 46px, and up to
   10px of offset. Without it, 58 and 58, dead on. */

       Length is the coarse signal here and OPACITY is the fine
       one — the lit ticks run 0.42 to 1 depending on how far
       behind the head they are, which is the part carrying the
       reading. At 26 the length was saying it too, loudly, and
       the ring read as a solid block with a ragged edge rather
       than as a band of marks.

       24 and not 23, and the difference is the WAVE. The lit
       ticks undulate by about 2.6 either way at the default,
       so a base of 23 put the trough at 20.4 against an unlit
       21 — some lit ticks were SHORTER than unlit ones, and a
       band whose edge dips below the ground it sits on reads
       as noise rather than as a run. 24 keeps the trough at
       21.4, just clear of it. Measured both.

       The comet came down with it: at 8 the head still stands
       out from the band by more than twice the base
