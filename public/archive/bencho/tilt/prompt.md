Add the "Tilt card" component from Bencho to my project.

It is MIT licensed — bencho.dev/licence. Please:

1. Create the component at a sensible path for this
   project, named TiltCard, from the source below.
2. It needs nothing beyond React.
3. Add the CSS to the project's stylesheet.

4. THE PART THAT NEEDS YOUR JUDGEMENT. The CSS reads
   these custom properties and does not define them:

     --surface-2

   They are Bencho's design tokens. Map each one to
   whatever this project already uses for the same
   job — its own ink, ground, surface and UI font —
   rather than defining them as new globals. If the
   project has no equivalent, define it locally on
   the component's own root so nothing leaks out.
   Anything ending -rgb wants three bare numbers,
   because the CSS builds rgba() from it.

5. BUTTERFLY is a stub
   — Bencho's own pictures are not licensed to
   travel. Point it at this project's images, or
   leave the placeholder and tell me.

Keep the comments. They say why the numbers are what
they are, and they are most of what makes this worth
copying rather than rewriting.

/* ══ Tilt ═════════════════════════════════════════════════
   A picture card that gives under the pointer.

   IT SINKS, IT DOES NOT LIFT. Every tilt card on the internet
   rotates TOWARD the cursor: the corner you are nearest rises
   to meet you and the card reads as a slab of glass catching
   the light. This one does the opposite — the point you are
   over goes AWAY, and the far side comes up. The difference
   is one minus sign and it is the whole component: a surface
   that rises to your finger is being displayed to you, and a
   surface that gives under it is being touched.

   Which means the sign is not a detail to get right by
   fiddling. Cursor at the top → the top edge has to go back,
   which is a POSITIVE rotateX; cursor at the right → the
   right edge goes back, which is a positive rotateY. Hence
   `rx = -ny` and `ry = +nx`, the negation of the usual pair.

   THE ROTATION ALONE IS NOT ENOUGH. A rotation about the
   centre is symmetric — the near side down, the far side up
   by the same amount — and on its own it reads as a card
   pivoting, not as one being pressed. What makes it a press
   is that the darkest point tracks the pointer: a depression
   catches shadow at its deepest, and the rim opposite catches
   light. Those two gradients are doing at least as much of
   the work as the transform is, and neither would convince on
   its own.

   ONE PAIR OF NUMBERS IS THE STATE. Two springs hold where
   the pointer is, normalised to -1..1, and the rotation, both
   gradients and the shadow are all read off them. Nothing
   here has a transition of its own — see the note on Sound
   for why that matters, which is the same reason. */

   The one number that decides whether this reads as a card
   turning or as a poster being sheared. Perspective is the
   distance from the viewer to the screen, so a small number
   is a face close to the glass: the near corner grows, the
   far corner shrinks, and ten degrees looks like thirty.

   800 against a 320px card is about two and a half card
   heights back — far enough that the foreshortening is a
   suggestion rather than a fisheye, close enough that the
   corners are visibly different sizes. It is not a knob
   because it is not a separate idea from the tilt: both
   answer "how 3D", and two sliders for one feeling is how a
   panel stops meaning anything. */

/* ── one spring, for everything that settles ───────────────
   The maths was already on this bench twice, copied by hand:
   Humidity's wheel and Brightness's column both accumulate
   velocity toward a target, damp it, and snap when both the
   delta and the velocity fall under 0.02. Two copies is a
   coincidence; five would be a policy, so it comes out here
   before the elastic blocks are written against it.

   The two shipped copies are deliberately NOT refactored onto
   this. They work, they are tuned, and rewriting the innards
   of two live components to prove a point about duplication
   is how a good afternoon becomes a bad one. This is the one
   new code uses.

   Frames, not milliseconds. `dt` is expressed in sixtieths of
   a second and the damping is RAISED to it rather than
   multiplied by it, so a dropped frame decays the same amount
   of energy as the two frames it replaced. Multiplying is the
   version that makes a spring behave differently on a busy
   page, which is the hardest kind of bug to see.

   The loop parks itself the moment the value has settled.
   CLAUDE.md is not complimentary about the one permanent
   requestAnimationFrame already on this bench and there is no
   case for five more. */

/* 0..100 into the two numbers a spring actually has.

   50 is what Humidity and Brightness were tuned at, which is
   the rule every elastic knob on this bench follows — see
   lab/motion. Turn the panel to the middle and nothing has
   changed.

   Both ends have to be usable, which is what fixes the range:
   at 0 it is slow and heavy and still arrives, at 100 it is
   quick with a visible overshoot, and nowhere in between does
   it ring for longer than it takes to read. */
/* The pair is chosen by DAMPING RATIO and then written back
   as stiffness and decay, because the ratio is the thing a
   person is actually setting and the two numbers on their own
   do not say what they add up to.

     zeta = -ln(d) / (2 * sqrt(k))

   The first version of this ran 0.06..0.26 stiffness against
   0.93..0.74 decay, which reads as a sensible spread and is
   not one: it puts zeta between 0.15 and 0.16 across the
   WHOLE range, so every setting overshot by about sixty per
   cent and the knob only changed how fast it did it. Pull's
   return went 130px past its own resting position and lifted
   the content off the top of the card.

     0   → zeta ~0.85, heavy, arrives without a ring
     50  → zeta ~0.41, near where Humidity and Brightness sit
     100 → zeta ~0.20, lively, two visible rebounds

   Both ends shippable, which is the constraint that fixed the
   numbers rather than taste. */
