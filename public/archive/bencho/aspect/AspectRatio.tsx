/* ══ Aspect ═══════════════════════════════════════════════
   A picture and three shapes to put it in.

   THE THREE FORMATS HAVE THE SAME AREA. That is the whole
   idea and it is not how most crop switchers are built —
   the common version fixes the width and lets the height do
   whatever the ratio says, which means the landscape is a
   third of the portrait and switching feels like the picture
   grew rather than like it was cropped. Equal area is what a
   crop actually is: the same amount of picture, held a
   different way. 276x207, 239x239 and 207x276 are within
   0.02% of each other.

   It also decides the frame. Every shape fits inside one
   276x276 square, so the block's bounding box is the biggest
   any of them gets and the wall never rescales it mid-move.

   NO CROP IN THE FILE. The source is 3:4 and stays that way
   — see scripts/sheep.sh — so `cover` does all three crops
   from one picture, and the portrait tab is the whole
   illustration rather than a slice of it. */

/* ── the icons are the shapes ──────────────────────────────
   Drawn rather than imported, and lucide does ship a
   rectangle in each orientation. The reason not to use them
   is that here the icon is not a symbol FOR the format, it
   IS the format — so it has to be at the real ratio, and
   lucide's rectangles are at whatever ratio looked right in
   a 24 grid.

   Same constant area as the pictures, for the same reason:
   three marks of visibly different size would say the
   formats are different sizes, which is the thing the block
   is at pains to say they are not. 13 square, and the other
   two are that area at 4:3 and 3:4. */

/* ── inlined from ./motion ──────────────────────── */
/* ── elastic, as numbers a person can hold ─────────────────
   Several blocks here are the same idea in different clothes:
   something travels, stretches on the way, and overshoots
   when it lands. Their character lives in a duration and in
   one control point of a bezier — which is exactly the kind
   of thing nobody should have to name in order to tune.

   So the outside of every elastic knob is 0..100 and the
   inside is real units, and **50 is always what the component
   was already tuned to**. Turn every knob on the bench to the
   middle and nothing has changed. That is what makes these
   safe to expose: the default is not a number somebody has to
   remember, it is the middle of the slider.

   Both ends have to be shippable, which is the constraint
   that actually shapes these curves. The ranges below stop
   where the effect stops being the thing it is — a bar that
   moves in 40ms still reads as a bar snapping to a slot; one
   that moves in 20ms reads as broken. */

/* How long it takes, slower to faster, as a multiplier on
   whatever the component's own tuned duration is. 0 is a
   little over half again as slow, 100 is two and a half times
   as fast, 50 is exactly 1. */
const rate = (speed: number) => 1.6 - (speed / 100) * 1.2;

/* How hard it lands.

   In a cubic-bezier the second control point's y is the whole
   of an overshoot: at 1 the thing stops dead on its target,
   and past 1 it travels beyond and comes back. Everything
   else in the curve is the approach and stays put.

   `tuned` is the y this component was drawn with, so 50
   returns it unchanged and the slider is centred on the
   design rather than on some shared average. */

            The same rule the detail overlay's block follows,

            same rounded frame throughout rather than as a
            rectangle being stretched. `cover` is what keeps
