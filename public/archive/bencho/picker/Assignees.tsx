/* ══ Assignees ════════════════════════════════════════════
   A pill that opens a list, and fills up with faces as you
   assign them. One, two, four — the pill grows to hold them
   and they overlap into a stack rather than a row.

   It was called "People picker", which named the widget
   rather than the job. What this is FOR is putting names
   against a thing — assigning a task, adding contributors —
   and the pill is the answer to "who is on this".

   THE PILL IS THE READOUT. There is no count badge and no
   "3 selected" caption: the faces themselves say who, which
   is the thing a person actually wants back. A number tells
   you how many you picked; a stack of faces tells you whether
   you picked the right ones. */

/* ── the cast ──────────────────────────────────────────────
   The same four pictures the rest of the bench uses — there
   are only four in avatars.ts and every block that needs
   people draws from them — under names of their own, which is
   what the selection list and the reorder list both do. Four
   blocks sharing one set of names would read as one dataset
   being shown four ways rather than four components. */
/* The names follow the PICTURES. avatars.ts keys are `kai`,
   `mara`, `sofia`, `ines` and none of them describes who is in
   the photograph — the reorder list and the selection list use
   the same four faces under different names, so the key is a
   slot rather than a person. Checked against the images at
   size rather than off the thumbnails: two men, two women. */

/* ── the other way to stack ────────────────────────────────
   A row of overlapping faces is the honest default: it says
   who, in order, and it grows sideways as you add people. But
   it grows sideways, and a pill in a dense toolbar cannot
   always afford that.

   So the second arrangement packs the same four into the
   footprint of ONE. Nothing overlaps — that is the whole point
   of it, and the reason it is not simply "a tighter row". A
   row hides parts of faces behind other faces; the quad shows
   all of every face and pays for it in size.

   The box is FACE across whatever the count, so the pill in
   this mode does not grow at all. That is the trade the mode
   exists to make, and drawing one face big and four faces
   small is what makes it visible: the box does not fill up,
   it SUBDIVIDES.

   Three is the awkward count. It fills reading order and
   leaves the last cell empty, which looks like a gap and is
   actually the point: the quad is a fixed set of four slots,
   and three people occupy three of them. Centring the odd one
   balances the picture but breaks the grid — the face lands
   where no cell is, and adding the fourth person then shunts
   it sideways for no reason the eye can name. */
const quad = (n: number, gut: number) => {
  const cell = (FACE - gut) / 2;
  const s = cell / FACE;
  const a = cell / 2;          /* centre of the near cell */

     the one thing every dropdown has to do. It is the wrong
     behaviour for a block on this wall.

     Measured: one real click anywhere on the page collapsed
     the list, and nothing brought it back — so the card spent
     the rest of the session showing a pill and nothing else,
     which is a demonstration of a third of the component. The
     same class of fault as a demo that leaves a toggle on.

     The pill is still the toggle, so it is still dismissible
     by the person actually using it. What is gone is the case
     where something you did to a DIFFERENT block put this one

               NOT a goo morph, and that was considered first:
               the reorder list took the metaball out from
               between its card and its button for the reason

               opening. A metaball is for a single body changing
               shape, which is also why the faces do not get one:
               they are photographs, and the filter thresholds
               alpha.

               The scale starts high — 0.86 across, 0.72 down —
