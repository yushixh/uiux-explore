/* ══ Seek ═════════════════════════════════════════════════
   A search icon that becomes a search field.

   ONE OBJECT, NOT TWO. Everything here follows from that. The
   obvious build is an icon that fades out and an input that
   fades in, and it is obvious because it is easy — but two
   things swapping is never mistaken for one thing changing,
   however well the crossfade is tuned. So there is a single
   box whose WIDTH is the state, and the icon and the field
   are both inside it the whole time.

   Which turns the interesting problems into geometry rather
   than choreography:

   · The lens never moves relative to the box. It sits at a
     fixed inset from the left edge, and at the closed width
     that inset happens to centre it — (44 - 18) / 2 is 13,
     and 13 is also the padding the open field wants. So one
     number is both "centred in a circle" and "aligned in a
     field", and the lens travelling leftward across the page
     is not an animation anybody wrote. It is the box growing
     around a mark that stayed put.

   · The box grows from its middle, so the composition stays
     centred at every frame. Growing from the left would pin
     the lens and throw the field off-centre; growing from the
     right would slide the lens across the page. Neither is
     the object transforming, and both are what you get by
     accident.

   · Height never changes and the corner is fully round at
     every width, so the SHAPE is one rule rather than a tween
     with two ends. At 44 it is a circle and at 320 a pill,
     and those are the same statement. The radius used to
     interpolate 22 → 13, which was a second thing that had
     to agree with the first; a stadium corner needs no
     agreement at all.

   The press is a real beat. A click compresses the object for
   a moment before it expands, because a thing that yields
   before it moves reads as having been pushed, and a thing
   that only moves reads as having been triggered. */

const clamp = (v: number, lo: number, hi: number) => Math.min(hi, Math.max(lo, v));

/* The closed object: a circle, so the width IS the height.
   Was 44, which is a header control — and this is not in a
   header, it is the whole component, sitting alone on a card
   with 96px of frame around it. At 44 the shut state read as a
   small button somebody had left in the middle of a large
   card. 60 is the size of the thing itself rather than the
   size it would be inside something else.

   The stylesheet reads this through --shut rather than
   repeating it: the skin's height and the closed width are the
   same number by definition, and two places holding it is two
   places to get it wrong. */
const SHUT = 64;
/* the lens, and its inset. See the note above — this number
   is doing two jobs and they agree by construction.

   28, measured against the rest of the bench rather than
   picked. Every round icon button here sits between 0.44 and
   0.50 of its button — .gdock-item 20/44, .bar-tool 17/38,
   .gnav-item 17/38, the nav's own 18/36 — and this button is
   64 across, so 28 puts it at 0.44, in with the others. 18
   was 0.28 and read as a small mark in a large circle.

   The STROKE is independent of this, which is the part I got
   wrong twice. The svg is an 18-unit viewBox, so a
   stroke-width of u units always draws at u/18 of the glyph's
   own size, whatever that size is — and lucide's 2-on-18 is
   the same 0.111. `stroke-width: 2` therefore matches the
   bench at any LENS, and resizing the icon does not disturb
   it. */
const LENS = 28;
const INSET = (SHUT - LENS) / 2;

/* the field's corner. 32 is half of its 64px height, which is
   the circle it is when shut and the pill it is when open. */
const CORNER = 32;

/* the resting field, wide screen and narrow. See the note on
   the `width` prop for why there are two.

   280 and not 240, which was the first answer and overshot:
   the button on a phone card is 64 x (260 / (field + 26)), so
   240 drew it at 63 against the 44 it started at — half again
   as big, which is a different component rather than a legible
   one. 280 lands at 54. The move that was actually wanted is
   the one you notice without being able to name it. */

/* ── inlined from ./spring ──────────────────────── */
/* ── one spring, for everything that settles ───────────────
   The maths was already on this bench twice, copied by hand:
   Humidity's wheel and Brightness's column both accumulate
   velocity toward a target, damp it, and snap when both the
   delta and the velocity fall under 0.02. Two copies is a
   coincidence; five would be a policy, so it comes out here
   before the elastic blocks are written against it.

   The two shipped copies are deliberately NOT refactored onto
   this. They work, they are tuned, and rewriting the innards
   of two live components to prove a point about duplication
   is how a good afternoon becomes a bad one. This is the one
   new code uses.

   Frames, not milliseconds. `dt` is expressed in sixtieths of
   a second and the damping is RAISED to it rather than
   multiplied by it, so a dropped frame decays the same amount
   of energy as the two frames it replaced. Multiplying is the
   version that makes a spring behave differently on a busy
   page, which is the hardest kind of bug to see.

   The loop parks itself the moment the value has settled.
   CLAUDE.md is not complimentary about the one permanent
   requestAnimationFrame already on this bench and there is no
   case for five more. */

/* 0..100 into the two numbers a spring actually has.

   50 is what Humidity and Brightness were tuned at, which is
   the rule every elastic knob on this bench follows — see
   lab/motion. Turn the panel to the middle and nothing has
   changed.

   Both ends have to be usable, which is what fixes the range:
   at 0 it is slow and heavy and still arrives, at 100 it is
   quick with a visible overshoot, and nowhere in between does
   it ring for longer than it takes to read. */
/* The pair is chosen by DAMPING RATIO and then written back
   as stiffness and decay, because the ratio is the thing a
   person is actually setting and the two numbers on their own
   do not say what they add up to.

     zeta = -ln(d) / (2 * sqrt(k))

   The first version of this ran 0.06..0.26 stiffness against
   0.93..0.74 decay, which reads as a sensible spread and is
   not one: it puts zeta between 0.15 and 0.16 across the
   WHOLE range, so every setting overshot by about sixty per
   cent and the knob only changed how fast it did it. Pull's
   return went 130px past its own resting position and lifted
   the content off the top of the card.

     0   → zeta ~0.85, heavy, arrives without a ring
     50  → zeta ~0.41, near where Humidity and Brightness sit
     100 → zeta ~0.20, lively, two visible rebounds

   Both ends shippable, which is the constraint that fixed the
   numbers rather than taste. */
