Add the "Slide to confirm" component from Bencho to my project.

It is MIT licensed — bencho.dev/licence. Please:

1. Create the component at a sensible path for this
   project, named SlideToConfirm, from the source below.
2. Install what it needs: npm i framer-motion lucide-react
3. Add the CSS to the project's stylesheet.

4. THE PART THAT NEEDS YOUR JUDGEMENT. The CSS reads
   these custom properties and does not define them:

     --card
     --fill-on
     --fill-on-rgb
     --fill-slab
     --font-ui
     --ink
     --ink-rgb
     --pane-edge

   They are Bencho's design tokens. Map each one to
   whatever this project already uses for the same
   job — its own ink, ground, surface and UI font —
   rather than defining them as new globals. If the
   project has no equivalent, define it locally on
   the component's own root so nothing leaks out.
   Anything ending -rgb wants three bare numbers,
   because the CSS builds rgba() from it.

Keep the comments. They say why the numbers are what
they are, and they are most of what makes this worth
copying rather than rewriting.

/* ══ Slide to confirm ═════════════════════════════════════
   A handle you push across a track. It follows the finger
   exactly, and past the mark it takes over and finishes the
   journey itself.

   THE HANDLE BECOMES THE ANSWER. On commit it does not hand
   over to a tick somewhere else — it unfurls leftward and
   fills the track it was crossing, and the arrow it was
   carrying becomes a check. One object changing shape, which
   is the case a morph is actually for, and the reason this
   needs no second element to say "done".

   The right edge does not move while that happens: the width
   grows by exactly what the offset loses. So the handle
   arrives, plants itself, and opens out behind it. */

     `GRIP + (anchor - x)`, so PAD + x + width comes to
     PAD + GRIP + anchor — a number with no x in it. The right
     edge is therefore stationary BY ARITHMETIC rather than by
     two animations agreeing.

     It was two: `x` on one spring and `width` on another with
     the same numbers, which is not the same thing at all. They
     start a frame apart and drift, and the right edge measured
     6.8px of wobble across the morph. One value read twice

     and nothing else happening, which reads as the animation
     stopping rather than as the thing landing. A dip of about
     three per cent and back gives it somewhere to arrive.

     On the TRACK, so the whole block gives at once — the
     handle is the track by then, and scaling the two
     separately would be two objects where there is one. It is
     the palette's beat, and the same trade: a scale drags the
     corner radius with it, which at 2.6% is under a pixel on a
     28px corner and nobody reads a pulse as a change of shape.

     Its own clock rather than the spring's. The spring is
     nearly there for most of its run, so a dip read off it
     would spike in the first two frames and be flat for the
     rest — the note the player's bounce carries. And the peak
     sits late, at 0.62, so the block gathers as it lands
     instead of pulsing before it. */

     trigger by knocking the handle, which is the single thing
     the gesture exists to prevent. The only honest answer is
     the end of the track, so the end is what it is. */

  /* ── SPEED, and deliberately not Bounce ──────────────────
     There was a Bounce knob and it had to go, for the reason
     the liquid toggle's did: this shape has a hard wall at
     both ends. On commit the handle exactly fills the track,
     so there is nowhere for an overshoot to go — and because
     the right edge is pinned by the arithmetic above, the
     overshoot came out of the LEFT edge instead. Measured at
     Bounce 50: the handle shot 42px out of its own track.

     A dial whose every setting above zero breaks the component
     is not a dial. Speed is the real question here — how fast
     it takes over once you let go — and the damping is derived
     to sit exactly on critical, so nothing overshoots at any
     setting of it.

     zeta = c / (2 * sqrt(k * m)), so c at zeta 1 is
     2 * sqrt(k * m). Written that way the knob can move the
     stiffness freely and the spring stays honest. */

     rather than stopping dead. The overshoot never shows as
     movement — `seen` clamps the position at the wall — it
     shows as the squash above, which is the same energy
     spent somewhere it fits. */

  /* ── THE DRAG IS FOLLOWED ON THE WINDOW ──────────────────
     It used to be followed on the track, with pointer capture
     to keep the events coming once the cursor left it. That is
     the textbook arrangement and it has one failure the
     textbook does not mention: capture is best-effort. The call
     is wrapped in a try/catch here — it throws on a synthetic
     pointer id — and a browser can also drop it mid-gesture, on
     its own, when a touch turns into a system gesture or the
     pointer leaves the window. When that happened the release
     landed on some other element, the track never heard it, and
     the handle sat held at the far end forever: reported as "I
     slide all the way to the end with my cursor outside the
     slider and it stays in a constant drag state".

     Listening on the window removes the dependency. The events
     reach it whatever they are retargeted to and whether or not
     the capture survived, so a release ANYWHERE ends the drag —
     which is what a slider promises: your finger owns the
     handle until you lift it, not until you wander off the
     track. Capture stays on because it still suppresses text
     selection and the grip's own hover, but nothing depends on
     it any more.

     ── AND IT IS BOUND AT THE PRESS, NOT IN AN EFFECT ───────
     The first version of this bound them from a `useEffect` on
     `held`, which is the tidier-looking arrangement and drops
     moves: an effect does not run until React has committed the
     render, and a fast flick can put its first pointermove in
     that gap. That first move is the one that sets the grab
     offset, so losing it means the whole drag does nothing —
     measured, with the handle sitting at home after a full
     sweep. Bound inside `down`, they are live on the same tick
     as the press. */

     The return spring is under-damped now, so it wants to
     carry past zero — and it cannot: at zero the handle is
     already against the end of its track, and four pixels of
     inset is not room to bounce in. Letting it through was
     measured at 42px outside the block when the commit spring
     was under-damped.

     So the position clamps and the energy that would have
     carried it past turns into compression instead. That is
     what a bounce off a wall IS, and it reads as a soft
     landing rather than a stop. `over` is the part of the
     spring that went past; the two scales are read off it, and
     they multiply so area is kept — the ball's rule.

       handle plants itself where it arrived and opens out
       behind it.

       Sending x to TRAVEL instead was the first version and it
       is worth recording, because it looked plausible in the
       comment and was measurably wrong: the handle stayed at
       the end AND grew to the full width, so its right edge
       came out at 675 against a 375px track and the block

     dark fill that left a near-invisible track with a dark
     circle sitting on it. Measured: track
     rgba(244,243,241,0.07) over a light stage.

     Slab and ink is the pair the liquid toggle uses and it
     inverts from one rule: white track with a near-black
     handle in light, near-black track with a light handle in
     dark. And on commit the handle fills the track, so the
     confirmed state is a solid ink pill in both. */

   THE SAME INK AS THE HANDLE, which turns this from a trail
   into the handle's own body. It was an 8% tint, and a tint is
   read as a progress bar: a track filling up behind a knob that
   slides along it. Two objects.

   The geometry was already right for one. This runs from the
   left pad to `x + GRIP` — the handle's RIGHT edge, not its
   left — with the handle's own corner radius, so the pair
   describes a single capsule with a rounded cap at each end and
   the handle's cap doing the work at the leading edge. Only the
   colour said otherwise. Matched, there is no seam to find: the
   dot stretches out of the corner it started in and the far end
   is still the dot.

   It cannot be the ink at 100% and also sit UNDER the words. */

     reaches zero at 55% of the travel and the capsule's edge
     arrives at the first letter around 30%, so there is a
     stretch where the two overlap. Painted over, the words are
     covered by the advancing cap instead: they leave under a
     rounded edge that is the handle's own shape, which reads as
     the thing eating them rather than as a wipe.

     a control, and the wrong one here: the track IS the object,

     off-centre rather than as considerate — there is nothing
     for it to be centred against except the pill.

     It costs nothing at rest — the words start well clear of
     the handle — and the overlap it was avoiding is now the
     point, since the capsule wipes them as it comes. */

   resting handle is 42, so the shared track was wider than the
   box holding it — and an overflowing grid item resolves
   `center` to `start`, which shoved both to one side. The same
